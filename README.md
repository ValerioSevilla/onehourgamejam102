# Tidy Up Your Shoes

Game prototype made with Unity game engine, originally developed as an [entry for One Hour Game Jam #102](http://onehourgamejam.com/?page=jam&jam=102). Made by one person in about 1 hour. Due to time constraints the gameplay was reduced to a minimum. Please take that into account!
